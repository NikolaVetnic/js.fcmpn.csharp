# Firebase Cloud Messaging Push Notifications Example

This is an example of using Firebase Cloud Messaging in C# to send a notification to a specific device running the Enmeshed app.

This code uses **Firebase Admin SDK** to send the notification. It is the desired way to send notifications to the Enmeshed app as it can send the content objects as part of notifications which the app can then process.

This is a working example on 19 July 2023.
